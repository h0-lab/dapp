## Task Overview

Setup CI/CD process using GitLab CI and dapp.

## Requirements

To begin, you'll need the following:
* Kubernetes cluster and the kubectl CLI tool configured to communicate with the cluster;
* Server with GitLab above 10.x version (or account on [SaaS GitLab](https://gitlab.com/));
* Docker registry (GitLab embedded or somewhere else);
* Host for build node (optional);
* An application you can successfully build and deploy with dapp;

## Infrastructure

![sdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/howto_gitlabci_scheme.png)

* Kubernetes cluster
* GitLab with docker registry enabled
* Build node
* Deployment node



We don't recommend to run dapp in docker as it can give an unexpected result.

In order to set up the CI/CD process, you need to describe build, deploy and cleanup stages. For all of these stages, a GitLab runner with shell executor is needed to run `dapp`.

Dapp use `~/.dapp/` folder to store build cache and other files. Dapp assumes this folder is preserved for all pipelines. That is why for build processes we don't recommend you to use environments which are don't preserve a GitLab runner's state (files between runs), e.g. some cloud environments.

We recommend you to use separate hosts for building (build node) and for deploying (deployment node). The reasons are:
* the deployment process needs access to the cluster through kubectl, and simply you can use a master node, but the build process needs more resources than the deployment process, and the master node typically has no such resources;
* the build process can affect on the master node and can affect on the whole cluster.

Also, it is not recommended to set up any node of the kubernetes cluster as a build node.

You need to set up GitLab runners with only two tags — `build` and `deploy` respectively for build stage and for deployment stage. The cleanup stage will use both runners and doesn't need separate runners or nodes.

Build node needs access to the application git repository and to the docker registry, while the deployment node additionally needs access to the kubernetes cluster.

### Base setup

On the build and the deployment nodes, you need to install and set up GitLab runners. Follow these steps on both nodes:

1. Create GitLab project and push project code into it.
1. Get a registration token for the runner: in your GitLab project open `Settings` —> `CI/CD`, expand `Runners` and find the token in the section `Setup a specific Runner manually`.
1. [Install gitlab-runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-manually.html):
    * `deployment runner` — on the master kubernetes node
    * `build runner` — on the separate host (not on any node of the kubernetes cluster) or on the master kubernetes node (not recommended for production)
1. Register the `gitlab-runner`.

    [Use these steps](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html) to register runners, but:
    * enter following tags associated with runners (if you have only one runner — enter both tags comma separated):
        * `build` — for build runner
        * `deploy` — for deployment runner
    * enter executor for both runners — `shell`;
1. Install Docker if it is absent.

    On the master kubernetes node Docker is already installed, and you need to [install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/#installing-docker) it only on your build node.
1. Add the `gitlab-runner` user into the `docker` group.
    ```bash
sudo usermod -Ga docker gitlab-runner
```
1. Install Dapp for the `gitlab-runner` user.

    You need to [install latest dapp]({{ site.baseurl }}/how_to/installation.html) for the `gitlab-runner` user on both nodes.

### Setup deploy runner

The deployment runner needs [helm](https://helm.sh/) and an access to the kubernetes cluster through the kubectl. An easy way is to use the master kubernetes node for deploy.

Make the following steps on the master node:
1. Install and init Helm.
    ```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get > get_helm.sh &&
chmod 700 get_helm.sh &&
./get_helm.sh &&
kubectl create serviceaccount tiller --namespace kube-system &&
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller &&
helm init --service-account tiller
```
1. Copy kubectl config to the home folder of the `gitlab-runner` user.
    ```bash
mkdir -p /home/gitlab-runner/.kube &&
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf /home/gitlab-runner/.kube/config &&
sudo chown -R gitlab-runner:gitlab-runner /home/gitlab-runner/.kube
```

## Pipeline

When you have working build and deployment runners, you are ready to set up GitLab pipeline.

When GitLab starts a job, it sets a list of [environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/README.html), and we will use some of them.

Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the project's root directory and add the following lines:

```yaml
variables:
  ## we will use this variable later as the name of kubernetes namespace for deploying application
  APP_NAMESPACE: ${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG}

stages:
  - build
  - deploy
  - cleanup_registry
  - cleanup_builder
```

We've defined the following stages:
* `build` — stage for building application images;
* `deploy` — stage for deploying built images on environments such as — stage, test, review, production or any other;
* `cleanup_registry` — stage for cleaning up registry;
* `cleanup_builder` — stage for cleaning up dapp cache on the build node.

> The ordering of elements in stages is important because it defines the order of execution of jobs.

### Build stage

Add the following lines to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
Build:
  stage: build
  script:
    ## used for debugging
    - dapp --version; pwd; set -x
    ## Always use "bp" option instead separate "build" and "push"
    ## It is important to use --tag-ci, --tag-branch or --tag-commit options here (in bp or push commands) otherwise cleanup won't work.
    - dapp dimg bp ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE} --tag-ci
  tags:
    ## You specify there the tag of the runner to use. We need to use there build runner
    - build
    ## Cleanup will use schedules, and it is not necessary to rebuild images on running cleanup jobs.
    ## Therefore we need to specify
    ##
  except:
    - schedules
```

For registry authorization on push/pull operations dapp use `CI_JOB_TOKEN` GitLab environment (see more about [GitLab CI job permissions model](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/new_ci_build_permissions_model.html)), and this is the most recommended way you to use (see more about [dapp registry authorization]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/registry/authorization.html)). In a simple case, when you use GitLab with enabled container registry in it, you needn't do anything for authorization.

If you want that dapp won't use `CI_JOB_TOKEN` or you don't use GitLab's Container registry (e.g. `Google Container Registry`) please read more [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/registry/authorization.html).

### Deploy stage

List of environments in `deploy` stage depends on your needs, but usually it includes:
* Review environment. It is a dynamic (or so-called temporary) environment for taking the first look at the result of development by developers. This environment will be deleted (stopped) after branch deletion in the repository or in case of manual environment stop.
* Test environment. The test environment may be used by developer when he ready to show his work. On the test environment, ones can manually deploy the application from any branches or tags.
* Stage environment. The stage environment may be used for taking final tests of the application, and deploy can proceed automatically after merging into master branch (but this is not a rule).
* Production environment. Production environment is the final environment in the pipeline. On production environment should be deployed the only production-ready version of the application. We assume that on production environment can be deployed only tags, and only after a manual action.

Of course, parts of CI/CD process described above is not a rule, and you can have your own.

First of all, we define a template for the deploy jobs — this will decrease the size of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` and will make it more readable. We will use this template in every deploy stage further.

Add the following lines to `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
.base_deploy: &base_deploy
  stage: deploy
  script:
    ## create k8s namespace we will use if it doesn't exist.
    - kubectl get ns ${APP_NAMESPACE} || kubectl create namespace ${APP_NAMESPACE}
    ## If your application use private registry, you have to:
    ## 1. create appropriate secret with name registrysecret in namespace kube-system of your k8s cluster
    ## 2. uncomment following lines:
    ##- kubectl get secret registrysecret -n kube-system -o json |
    ##                  jq ".metadata.namespace = \"${APP_NAMESPACE}\"|
    ##                  del(.metadata.annotations,.metadata.creationTimestamp,.metadata.resourceVersion,.metadata.selfLink,.metadata.uid)" |
    ##                  kubectl apply -f -
    - dapp --version; pwd; set -x
    ## Next command makes deploy and will be discussed further
    - dapp kube deploy
        --tag-ci
        --namespace ${APP_NAMESPACE}
        --set "global.env=${CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG}"
        --set "global.ci_url=$(echo ${CI_ENVIRONMENT_URL} | cut -d / -f 3)"
        ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}
  ## It is important that the deploy stage depends on the build stage. If the build stage fails, deploy stage should not start.
  dependencies:
    - Build
  ## We need to use deploy runner, because dapp needs to interact with the kubectl
  tags:
    - deploy
```

Pay attention to `dapp kube deploy` command. It is the main step in deploying the application and note that:
* it is important to use `--tag-ci`, `--tag-branch` or `--tag-commit` options here (in `dapp kube deploy`) otherwise you can't use dapp templates `dapp_container_image` and `dapp_container_env` (see more [about deploy]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/deploy/templates.html));
* we've used the `APP_NAMESPACE` variable, defined at the top of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (it is not one of the GitLab [environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/README.html));
* we've passed the `global.env` parameter, which will contain the name of the environment. You can access it in `helm` templates as `.Values.global.env` in Go-template's blocks, to configure deployment of your application according to the environment;
* we've passed the `global.ci_url` parameter, which will contain an URL of the environment. You can use it in your `helm` templates e.g. to configure ingress.

#### Review

As it was said earlier, review environment — is a dynamic (or temporary, or developer) environment for taking the first look at the result of development by developers.

Add the following lines to `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
Review:
  <<: *base_deploy
  environment:
    name: review/${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
    ## Of course, you need to change domain suffix (`kube.DOMAIN`) of the url if you want to use it in you helm templates.
    url: http://${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}.kube.DOMAIN
    on_stop: Stop review
  only:
    - branches
  except:
    - master
    - schedules

Stop review:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - dapp --version; pwd; set -x
    - dapp kube dismiss --namespace ${APP_NAMESPACE} --with-namespace
  environment:
    name: review/${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
    action: stop
  tags:
    - deploy
  only:
    - branches
  except:
    - master
    - schedules
  when: manual
```

We've defined two jobs:
1. Review.
    In this job, we set a name of the environment based on CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG GitLab variable. For every branch, GitLab will create a unique environment.

    The `url` parameter of the job you can use in you helm templates to set up e.g. ingress.

    Name of the kubernetes namespace will be equal `APP_NAMESPACE` (defined in dapp parameters in `base_deploy` template).
2. Stop review.
    In this job, dapp will delete helm release in namespace `APP_NAMESPACE` and delete namespace itself (see more about [dapp kube dismiss]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/cli/kube_dismiss.html)). This job will be available for the manual run and also it will run by GitLab in case of e.g branch deletion.

Review jobs needn't run on pushes to git master branch, because review environment is for developers.

As a result, you can stop this environment manually after deploying the application on it, or GitLab will stop this environment when you merge your branch into master with source branch deletion enabled.

#### Test

We've decided to don't give an example of a test environment in this howto because test environment is very similar to stage environment (see below). Try to describe test environment by yourself and we hope you will get a pleasure.

#### Stage

As you may remember, we need to deploy to the stage environment only code from the master branch and we allow automatic deploy.

Add the following lines to `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
Deploy to Stage:
  <<: *base_deploy
  environment:
    name: stage
    url: http://${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}.kube.DOMAIN
  only:
    - master
  except:
    - schedules
```

We use `base_deploy` template and define only unique to stage environment variables such as — environment name and URL. Because of this approach, we get a small and readable job description and as a result — more compact and readable `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

#### Production

The production environment is the last and important environment as it is public accessible! We only deploy tags on production environment and only by manual action (maybe at night?).

Add the following lines to `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
Deploy to Production:
  <<: *base_deploy
  environment:
    name: production
    url: http://www.company.my
  only:
    - tags
  when: manual
  except:
    - schedules
```

Pay attention to `environment.url` — as we deploy the application to production (to public access), we definitely have a static domain for it. We simply write it here and also use in helm templates as `.Values.global.ci_url` (see definition of `base_deploy` template earlier).

### Cleanup stages

Dapp has an efficient cleanup functionality which can help you to avoid overflow registry and disk space on build nodes. You can read more about dapp cleanup functionality [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/registry/cleaning.html).

In the results of dapp works, we have images in a registry and a build cache. Build cache exists only on build node and to the registry dapp push only built images.

There are two stages — `cleanup_registry` and `cleanup_builder`, in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for the cleanup process. Every stage has only one job in it and order of stage definition (see `stages` list in the top of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file) is important.

The first step in the cleanup process is to clean registry from unused images (built from stale or deleted branches and so on — see more [about dapp cleanup]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/registry/cleaning.html)). This work will be done on the `cleanup_registry` stage. On this stage, dapp connect to the registry and to the kubernetes cluster. That is why on this stage we need to use deploy runner. From kubernetes cluster dapp gets info about images are currently used by pods.

The second step — is to clean up cache on build node **after** registry has been cleaned. The important word is — after, because dapp will use info from the registry to clean up build cache, and if you haven't cleaned registry you won't get an efficiently cleaned build cache. That's why is important that the `cleanup_builder` stage starts after the `cleanup_registry` stage.

Add the following lines to `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
Cleanup registry:
  stage: cleanup_registry
  script:
    - dapp --version; pwd; set -x
    - dapp dimg cleanup repo ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}
  only:
    - schedules
  tags:
    - deploy

Cleanup builder:
  stage: cleanup_builder
  script:
    - dapp --version; pwd; set -x
    - dapp dimg stages cleanup local
        --improper-cache-version
        --improper-git-commit
        --improper-repo-cache
        ${CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE}
  only:
    - schedules
  tags:
    - build
```

To use cleanup you should create `Personal Access Token` with necessary rights and put it into the `DAPP_DIMG_CLEANUP_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` environment variable. You can simply put this variable in GitLab variables of your project. To do this, go to your project in GitLab Web interface, then open `Settings` —> `CI/CD` and expand `Variables`. Then you can create a new variable with a key `DAPP_DIMG_CLEANUP_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` and a value consisting `Personal Access Token`.

> Note: `DAPP_DIMG_CLEANUP_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` environment variable is used by dapp only for deleting images in registry when run `dapp dimg cleanup repo` command. In the other cases dapp uses `CI_JOB_TOKEN`.

For demo project simply create `Personal Access Token` for your account. To do this, in GitLab go to your settings, then open `Access Token` section. Fill token name, make check in Scope on `api` and click `Create personal access token` — you'll get the `Personal Access Token`.

Both stages will start only by schedules. You can define schedule in `CI/CD` —> `Schedules` section of your project in GitLab Web interface. Push `New schedule` button, fill description, define cron pattern, leave the master branch in target branch (because it doesn't affect on cleanup), check on Active (if it's not checked) and save pipeline schedule. That's all!
